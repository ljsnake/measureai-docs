## Getting Started

MeasureAI supports taking photos via mobile smartphone, or with a desktop or laptop PC.

### Sleeves

Sometimes the sleeves can obscure part of the clothing, especially where the chest or body width is measured. 

Expose the body width points, and lay the whole sleeves flat as shown in the examples below.
